# <img alt="OSCAL Compass Logo" width="100px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscal-compass/community/main/assets/oscal-compass-color.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> Welcome to the OSCAL Compass project

The OSCAL Compass project is a set of tools that enable the creation, validation, and governance of documentation artifacts for compliance needs. It leverages NIST's OSCAL ([Open Security Controls Assessment Language](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)) as a standard data format for interchange between tools and people, and provides an opinionated approach to OSCAL SDK and adoption by policy engines.

The OSCAL Compass project is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io)

## Learn about the Projects

[Trestle](https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-trestle) - Command line tool and SDK for interacting with OSCAL-based compliance-as-code documents

[Agile Authoring](https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-trestle-agile-authoring) - Ready to use CI/CD pipeline configuration and setup using a GitOps approach and Trestle SDK for human and machine readable OSCAL compliance documents collaborative authoring. Manage semantic versioning, provenance traceability, change log, and approval based release to foster continuous compliance.

[Compliance to Policy](https://github.com/oscal-compass/compliance-to-policy) (AKA C2P) - C2P is a plugin-based tool that transforms compliance-as-code artifacts represented in OSCAL into native formats understood by policy validation or enforcement engines, and collects and normalizes their native results into OSCAL audit required format. It supports multiple policy engines such as [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) (for Kubernetes resources), [Open Cluster Management Policy Framework](https://open-cluster-management.io/) (for Kubernetes resources), [Auditree](https://auditree.github.io/) (generic), and others.
