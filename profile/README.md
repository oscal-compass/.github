# <img alt="OSCAL Compass Logo" width="100px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oscal-compass/community/main/assets/oscal-compass-color.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> Welcome to the OSCAL Compass project

The OSCAL Compass project is set of tools that enable the creation, validation, and governance of documentation artifacts for compliance needs. It leverages NIST's OSCAL ([Open Security Controls Assessment Language](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)) as a standard data format for interchange between tools and people, and provides an opinionated approach to OSCAL SDK and adoption by policy engines.

The OSCAL Compass project is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io)
